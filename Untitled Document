To train the net dataset is comprised of SCUT datasets,
The KITTI Vision daatset and coco datasets. SCUT datasets
is used for positive hand case, The KITTI Vision daatset
and coco is used for negative hand case. All imges were re-
sized to 160 X 120 sizes images. we have to detect only one
object( Hand) which will be of sufficient size if present be-
cause image is capture in ego vision. which helps in reduc-
ing model size. Randomly 55551 images is selected from-
SCUT datasets and 39033 form coco and The KITTI Vision
daatset . So totally 94584 images is used. out of these total
image, ramdomly 55000 is selected for training, 15000 for
validation and 24584 for Testing
